## Description

I developed this SVG Logo Generator with the intention of evaluating my competence and understanding of node.js, particularly the methodologies employed for code testing. This endeavor allowed me to hone my proficiency in utilizing jest, leveraging standard node libraries, devising a structured directory layout, implementing constructor functions, refining my grasp of inheritance, and effectively managing promises. Beyond skill enhancement, this project furnishes a convenient utility for crafting uncomplicated logos to serve upcoming projects.

## Installation
To deploy this code yourself, navigate to the repository found at https://github.com/haniadenm/module_10_hw. Upon reaching the repository's page, locate the "Code" button and select either HTTPS or SSH to copy the repository's link. Subsequently, open Git Bash and navigate to your chosen directory where you intend to clone this code. Once there, input the command "git clone" followed by pasting the copied link. This action will result in the code being cloned to your local machine.

After the cloning process, execute the command "npm install" in your terminal to ensure the necessary dependencies are installed for running the code. Once the installation is complete, open your terminal and enter "node index.js" to execute the code within the terminal. As the prompts emerge, provide your responses accordingly.

Upon successful execution, the code will generate a result based on your inputs.

## Usage
Execute the command "node index.js" in your terminal to initiate the code, and respond to the prompts as they unfold. Upon successful completion, an SVG logo will be created in the "examples" folder, using the title you provided during the prompts.

Here's a demonstration illustrating the correct utilization for both testing and regular functionality:
